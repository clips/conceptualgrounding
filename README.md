## Requirements

All requirements are listed in **requirements.txt**. 

You can run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, preferably in a virtual environment.

## Data

For convenience, we only provide our adaptation of the openly available MedMentions corpus. \
The source files for this corpus can be found at https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/MedMentions.

The script **data/extract_medmentions.py** has used these source files to create **data/medmentions.json**.

## Data

We provide 2 scripts to run experiments from the paper. 

**main_dan.py** trains and evaluates the DAN encoder on **data/medmentions.json**. \
Please run `python main_dan.py --help` to see the options, or check the script. \
The default parameters are the best parameters reported in our paper.

**main_bne.py** trains and evaluates our counterpart implementation of the BNE encoder, as described in:

    publisher = "Association for Computational Linguistics",
    pages = "3275--3285"}
    
Please run `python main_bne.py --help` to see the options, or check the script. \
The default parameters are the best parameters reported in our paper.
